# Image Structure

This document describes how images from the SHIDC-B-Ki-67 and BCData datasets are organized after preprocessing.

---

## General Format & Organization

- **Final format:** `.jpg` (all images in JPEG)
- **Annotations:** Each image has a corresponding `.json` annotation file with the same base name

---

## SHIDC-B-Ki-67 Dataset

- **Original format:** `.jpg`
- **Size bare images:** `1228 x 1228 x 3`
- **Size 256x256 cropped images:** `256 x 256 x 3` Not used in this research.
- **Naming convention:** Files are named using the pattern `[patient_id]_[image_id]_[crop_id]`. Each image has a corresponding label file with the same base name. Example: `p1_0300_2.jpg` and `p1_0300_2.json`

## BCData Dataset

- **Original format:** `.png`
- **Size images:** `640 x 640 x 3`
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Converted to `.jpg`
  - Annotation data merged from .h5 files to .json
  - Files renamed and reorganized
- **Naming convention:** `[sample_id]`. Each image has a corresponding label file with the same base name. Example: `2.jpg` and `2.json`
