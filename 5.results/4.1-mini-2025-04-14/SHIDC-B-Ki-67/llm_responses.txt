This image shows cells with nuclear staining consistent with Ki-67 immunohistochemistry in breast tissue, with brown nuclei indicating immunopositive cells and blue/pale nuclei indicating immunonegative cells.

Step 1: Counting immunopositive cells (brown-stained nuclei)
I count approximately 25 immunopositive cells.

Step 2: Counting immunonegative cells (not brown-stained nuclei)
I count approximately 27 immunonegative cells.

Step 3: Calculate Ki-67 index:
Ki-67 Index = (Number of positive cells / (Number of positive cells + Number of negative cells)) × 100  
Ki-67 Index = (25 / (25 + 27)) × 100 = (25 / 52) × 100 ≈ 48.08%
